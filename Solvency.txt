To mitigate solvency risk, regulators like the PRA (UK), RBI (India), or Federal Reserve (US) require banks to submit a variety of reports that assess capital adequacy, asset quality, and overall financial health. Key reports include:

1. Capital Adequacy Reports
Common Reporting (COREP) under Basel III: Includes details of capital structure, capital ratios (like CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital), and risk-weighted assets (RWA).

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP): A self-assessment by banks of their capital needs based on their risk profile and future projections.

Pillar 3 Disclosures: Public disclosures on risk exposure and capital adequacy to promote market discipline.

2. Stress Testing Reports
Reports based on regulatory stress test scenarios to evaluate if the bank can withstand severe but plausible economic downturns.

Banks submit results of stress scenarios affecting credit, market, and operational risks.

3. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) Reports
Though primarily for liquidity risk, these indirectly support solvency by ensuring short-term and long-term funding adequacy.

4. Financial Statements & Audited Reports
Regular submission of balance sheets, profit & loss statements, and annual reports to show profitability and retained earnings, which impact solvency.

5. Leverage Ratio Reporting
To ensure banks are not excessively leveraged, which can amplify solvency risk.

6. Asset Quality Review (AQR)
Reports on non-performing assets (NPAs), provisions, and write-offs.

These reports help regulators assess:

Whether the bank has enough capital to absorb losses.

The quality of its assets.

Its risk exposure and management effectiveness.
